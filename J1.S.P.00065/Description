Program Specifications
Create a program allows input:
o	Student information includes: Student name, class name, the marks Math, Physical and Chemistry in the range from 1 to 10.
 Display on screen the information:
o	Student Type following the conditions: 
	A: mark > 7.5.
	B: 6 <= mark <= 7.5.
	C: 4 <= mark < 6 .
	D: mark < 4.
o	Student Type statistics by %.
Function details: 
Function 1: Display GUI And Input Data.
•	Users run the program. The program prompts users to input Student data.
•	When users stop inputting Student data, next Function 2.
Function 2: Perform function
•	The program classifies students and gives student rank statistics by %.
•	Display notify result of students together with statistic result and exit the program.

Expectation of User interface:

 

Guidelines
Student must implement the methods
-	createStudent 
-	averageStudent
-	getPercentTypeStudent 
in startup code.
Suggestion:
Create a class Student contains the following properties: 
-	Student Name, Class, Math, Physical, Chemistry, Average, Type.
Create a class Mark Calculation, classify students, calculate Student Type statistics, and set the results on Student object. 
Give the statistics:
A:? %
B:? %
C:? %
D:? %
